# Faculty Finder: End-to-End Data Engineering & Search System

A professional-grade, modular system designed to scrape, clean, store, and serve faculty directory data. This project demonstrates a full-stack data engineering lifecycle—from raw web acquisition to an interactive search interface.

## Project Overview

**Faculty Finder** automates the ingestion of academic profiles. It handles the complexities of scraping multi-pattern university directories, standardizing irregular HTML data, and providing high-performance access via both a REST API and a visual dashboard.

### Key Milestones
- **Acquisition**: Successfully scraped **109 faculty profiles** from 5 recursive university directory structures.
- **Data Engineering**: Built a robust ETL pipeline ensuring 100% data standardization (zero null values).
- **Storage**: Implemented a relational SQLite database with secondary indexing for optimal query speeds.
- **Accessibility**: Developed a triple-entry access system: REST API, Interactive UI, and a dedicated Export Utility.

## Technical Implementation Deep-Dive

### 1. Smart & Strong Web Scraping
Websites can be tricky to scrape, so we built a high-quality scraper that:
- **Finds Everything**: It automatically searches through different sections like permanent faculty, adjuncts, and international professors.
- **Never Gives Up**: We used a library called **Tenacity**. If the internet is slow or a page fails to load, the scraper automatically tries again multiple times until it succeeds.
- **Acts Like a Human**: It doesn't spam the website. It waits a few seconds between pages and uses "human-like" settings so it doesn't get blocked.

### 2. Cleaning the Data (ETL)
Raw data from websites is usually messy. Our system does "Data Cleaning" to make it perfect:
- **Fixes Emails**: Some emails were written like `name [at] daiict [dot] ac [dot] in` to stop bots. Our system automatically fixes them back to `name@daiict.ac.in`.
- **No Empty Gaps**: If any information (like a phone number) is missing, we label it as "Not Provided" so the app always looks clean and consistent.
- **Smart Correction**: If a professor put their life story in the "Specialization" box by mistake, our system is smart enough to detect it and move it to the "Biography" section automatically.

### 3. High-Performance Search
The system uses the SQLite **LIKE** operator combined with B-Tree indexes on `name` and `email` to provide sub-millisecond search results across 109 biographies and specializations.

## How to Access the Data

This project is built for various stakeholders, from researchers to software developers.

### A. The Search Dashboard (For Everyone)
The Streamlit UI provides a visual way to explore the directory.
```bash
# To run the UI
streamlit run app/main_app.py
```
- **Local URL**: `http://localhost:8501`
- **Network URL**: `http://10.200.24.147:8501`

### B. The REST API (For Developers)
For those integrating this data into other apps.
```bash
# To start the API server
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```
- **Direct Download (CSV)**: `http://10.200.24.147:8000/api/faculty/export/csv`
- **Direct Download (JSON)**: `http://10.200.24.147:8000/api/faculty/export/json`

### C. The Export Utility (For Data Analysts)
If you prefer Jupyter, we have provided a "one-click" export script.
- **File**: `notebooks/05_data_export.ipynb`
- **Result**: Running this notebook will generate `faculty_data_export.csv` and `.json` in the local directory.

# 🚀 Phase 2 Upgrade: AI Intelligence & Cloud Deployment

## Phase 2 Architecture: The "Cognitive Layer"

This diagram illustrates how the new AI engine integrates with the existing data layer, packaged within Docker containers.

```mermaid
graph LR
    User[User @ Streamlit Cloud] -->|Search 'DL'| UI[Streamlit UI Container]
    
    subgraph "Docker Swarm Logic"
    UI -->|Query Expansion| EXP["Regex Tokenizer"]
    EXP -->|'Deep Learning'| REC["TF-IDF Engine"]
    REC <-->|Cosine Similarity| VEC[("Vector Embeddings (Pickle)")]
    end
    
    REC -->|Ranked IDs| DB[("SQLite Database")]
    DB -->|Rich Profiles| UI
    UI -->|Visual Cards| User
```

## 1. AI Recommendation Engine
Gone are the days of simple keyword matching. We implemented a **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity** engine to "understand" research topics.
*   **Semantic Search**: Searching for "Deep Learning" will find professors who specialize in "Neural Networks" or "AI", even if they don't use the exact words.
*   **Abbreviation Intelligence**: The engine uses a regex-based expansion layer. If you type **"DL"**, it automatically expands to **"deep learning"**; "NLP" becomes "natural language processing", etc.
*   **Match Scoring**: Every result gets a percentage score (e.g., "96% Match") so you know exactly how relevant a professor is to your query.

## 2. Premium UI (Dark Mode)
The dashboard was completely redesigned for a specialized information experience.
*   **Obsidian Dark Theme**: A clean, professional interface that reduces eye strain.
*   **Dynamic Sidebars**: Clicking "Details" opens a rich profile view on the side without navigating away from your search results.
*   **Smart Feedback**: The search bar provides real-time feedback, showing captions like `Expansion applied: deep learning` so users trust the AI.

## 3. Docker & Cloud Deployment
The entire system is now containerized and lives in the cloud.
*   **Dockerized**: We use `docker-compose` to spin up both the API (FastAPI) and the UI (Streamlit) in isolated containers with auto-recovery policies.
*   **Streamlit Cloud**: The app is live-deployed, making it accessible to anyone with a browser, anywhere in the world.
